This project was done in insight in the course of ~2-3 weeks.

## Motivation
Reddit is a social media network which is rich in cultures.

My motivations are twofolds:

1. N-grams viewer allows data scientist to investigate for topics trends, language analysis, etc. that happens in Reddit as a function of time
2. I'm interested in subreddits graph, how they are connected to each others by means of common users.
